### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself right from within the Service. Poof!

You can always log into your Account (if you have one, of course!) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, modify, or delete your info. You can also totally reach out to us to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Data you've dished out to us. 🤳

But keep in mind, we might need to hang onto certain info when we have a legal obligation or a legit basis to do so. Just a heads-up!

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but let's be real: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally try our best to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. Period. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has provided us with Personal Data, please hit us up. If we ever discover that we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to delete that info from our servers. 🧒🚫

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might totally ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. 🔗

We have zero control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just keeping it real!
