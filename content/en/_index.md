    Amazon AWS has unveiled a full-stack Agent development tool. At the re:Invent conference, AWS introduced several new **Agentic AI** products. Its new [SDK Toolkit (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/358627.html) enables AI to directly control physical devices. The models now boast situational memory capabilities 🧠. Automated reasoning ensures enterprise-grade data security. The era of human-AI co-creation has officially begun! 🚀<br>![AI News: AWS Agent Development Panorama](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbmz31tae3mt0z7x169gabhs.avif)

3.  **Google Unveils Zero-Code AI Agent Building Platform.**
    Google has rolled out a no-code AI agent building platform. Workspace Studio empowers even regular employees to create AI agents. Leveraging the **Gemini 3** model, it achieves full-process automation. The [Tool Introduction (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23361) shows it can handle complex tasks without any programming. It integrates with third-party applications like Gmail and Jira, truly making everyone an AI architect! 🛠️<br></video>

4.  **Keling AI Releases Audio-Visual Sync Video Model.**
    Keling AI has launched an audio-visual sync video model. The Keling Video 2.6 version now features **simultaneous audio and video output**. [Watch Demo (AI News)](https://www.xiaohu.ai/c/xiaohu-ai/video-2-6) to see perfect lip-syncing with the sound. The model understands semantics and matches corresponding environmental sound effects. Character speech emotions and atmosphere are now much more realistic. AI videos are finally not silent films anymore! 🎉

5.  **Zhongqing Robot T800 Shows Off Astonishing Athletic Ability.**
    Zhongqing Robot's T800 demonstrates astonishing athletic ability. The new humanoid robot T800 released a real-shot video.

### Frontier Research

1.  **OpenAI Trains Models to Proactively "Confess" Errors.**
    OpenAI is training models to proactively "confess" errors. Researchers have proposed a new **confession training** method. [Paper Details (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/358618.html) show that models generate independent violation reports. Even if the main answer lies, the confession report remains honest. This is like giving AI an independent conscience. This monitoring mechanism makes AI much more controllable! 🧠

2.  **DeepSeek's New Model Shows Astonishing Thinking Mode Consumption.**
    DeepSeek's new model exhibits astonishing thinking mode consumption. The long-thought version of DeepSeek-V3.2 is reported to be incredibly token-intensive. [Technical Analysis (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2025-12-04-10) reveals its consumption is three times that of Gemini. This could be due to a length bias caused by the **GRPO algorithm**. The model becomes verbose to avoid penalties. Efficiency optimization is definitely the next big challenge! 📈

3.  **Leading Large Models Bet on "Interleaved Thinking" Technology.**
    Leading large models are betting big on "Interleaved Thinking" technology. Both MiniMax and DeepSeek are implementing this tech. [Principle Analysis (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651005516&idx=2&sn=52f3b5b889dc94f67b84d939317b064f) shows that it allows models to think and call tools simultaneously. This iterative process solves the "forgetfulness" problem in long tasks. Agents thus gain stronger self-correction capabilities. This is truly a key technology for getting complex tasks done! 🛠️<br>![AI News: Interleaved Thinking Technology Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbmz69t9edkttkhs5cyczr68.avif)

4.  **AI Models Uncover Multi-Million Dollar Contract Vulnerabilities.**
    AI models have uncovered multi-million dollar contract vulnerabilities. Models like GPT-5 showed formidable performance in simulated attacks, even discovering unknown security flaws. 💸 [Research Report (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23358) points out that tests covered over 400 real attack scenarios, with each attack, on average, generating net profit. AI acts as both a hacker and the strongest shield! 🛡️<br>![AI News: Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Data](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbmz6dp9f1srn1es5q5sbked.avif)

5.  **Prompt Reconstruction During Inference Boosts Generation Quality.**
    Prompt reconstruction during inference enhances generation quality. A single prompt often struggles to produce perfect images 🎨. [Paper Link (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03534) proposes automatically rewriting prompts during inference. The PRIS framework can identify defect patterns in generated images. VBench benchmark scores consequently improved by 15%. So, good images rely not only on the model but also on good prompts! 📈

6.  **CuES Framework Enables Agents to Autonomously Generate Tasks.**
    The CuES framework enables Agents to autonomously generate tasks. Agents struggle without training tasks in new environments 🧩. [New Framework (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01311) uses curiosity-driven autonomous exploration. Agents can invent tasks based on environmental structure, no human-provided seed data or corpora needed. This truly teaches AI "how to learn"! 💡

7.  **Weight-Based Fingerprinting Technology Protects Model IP.**
    Weight-based fingerprinting technology protects model IP. There's a new method to protect the intellectual property of large models 🔒. [SELF Technology (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03620) generates fingerprints by analyzing attention weights. It effectively resists pruning and fine-tuning attacks. Fingerprint extraction is based on singular value decomposition principles. Model thieves now have nowhere to hide! 🚫

8.  **PromptBridge Achieves Cross-Model Prompt Migration.**
    PromptBridge enables cross-model prompt migration. Prompt invalidation when switching models is a common pain point 😫. [Migration Framework (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1996232377908306360) can automatically establish mappings between models. It "translates" prompts from a source model to a new model. This eliminates the need for expensive retraining processes. Developers can finally be free from constant prompt tweaking! 🌉<br>![AI News: Prompt Migration Framework PromptBridge](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/12/news_01kbmz6j65egqr0mar49zmc6hc.avif)
