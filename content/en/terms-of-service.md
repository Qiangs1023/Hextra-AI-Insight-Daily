# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it 'the Site' or 'us' from now on). Before you get started with our services, please, please, please read these Terms of Service thoroughly. By jumping in and using the Site, you're pretty much saying 'Yep, I agree!' to everything here.

## 1. Service Overview
What do we offer? Well, the Site is your go-to for paid subscription content and exclusive member services! Think blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and even community interaction. Heads up, though: some of these goodies are only for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users, to get your account set up, you'll need to provide a valid email address and create a password. Easy peasy! ✨
*   Users are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account** – that's a big no-no! 🚫
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Don't say we didn't warn ya! ⚠️

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and you'll see all the juicy details about the fees clearly displayed on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💰
*   All payments are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). The best part? The Site never stores your payment info. Your deets are safe with them! ✅
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Keep an eye on those dates! 📅
*   Okay, let's talk about our **14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-time subscriber and aren't happy with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. If it's been more than 14 days or you're not a first-timer, sorry folks, but **no refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely forces us to. Tough luck! 🤷‍♀️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission. Keep it original, folks! ©
*   Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content, purely for personal learning and reading. It's for you, and only you! 📖
*   For any commercial use or if you want to quote a lot, please reach out to the Site for authorization. Let's chat first! 🤝

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or rights-infringing content. Let's keep it clean and respectful here! 🚫
*   Users are also **prohibited** from mass downloading, scraping, or cracking member content using technical means. Seriously, don't try to pull a fast one! 🛠️⛔
*   The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. We're not afraid to drop the hammer! 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads up, things might shift around! 🔄
*   The Site will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands! ☁️

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). We're not your lawyers or doctors! 🚫👩‍⚕️👨‍⚖️
*   The Site is **not responsible for any direct or indirect losses** users might incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, folks! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. California dreaming! 🌴
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms? Both parties should try to sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't work, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. See you in court (hopefully not)! 🏛️
